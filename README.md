# Dicee-iOS-App

Hi! I created this iOS app as part of a course on Udemy. I implemented it using Swift programming language. This app rolls a pair of digital dice whenever the phone is given a shake gesture or when the "Roll" button is pressed, helpful if you like playing cards or boardgames and you keep losing your dice :)
